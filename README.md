# Semester Routine Website

This is a routine website which is based on my University Class routine of my Current Semester.

## what is the purpose of this website?

As we all know our university website sucks everytime. There is no full form fo teacher's name. We have to take a seat with 10 classmates and see our routine. Its so much boring and hilarious. So i came up with this idea to make a routine website where we can see our routine interactively and its nice.

## How to use this website?

You guys can clone this `repo` and update the `public/Routine.json` file. Then you can visit this website and see your routine.

## what is next?

I'm going to keep this website simple also start working on Mobile App soon. Any contribution is welcome.
